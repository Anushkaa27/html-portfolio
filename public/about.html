<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>My name is Anushka Singh. I am from Faridabad, Haryana. I am pursuing computer science engineering from Vellore Institute of Technology. Academically speaking, I had secured a percentage of 94.6 in class 10th, 89.8 in class 12th and currently my CGPA in university is at a point of 8.80.</p>

<p>Computer Science is Omnipresent, so, it is present in every other field or things that you might not even notice. Hence, this ignited my interest into the fields and I started my journey towards software development.</p>

<p> My technical skills include programming in C++ and databases along with familiarity with web development and I have also used my skills to build several projects including Meditrack(a healthcare website) and Asaan-4-Kisaan(an application made to help the farmers of India). Now, except for that I always try to up-skill myself and acclimate my skills to stay up-to-date.</p>

<p>Additionally, I have participated in hackathons and won some too. Coming to co-curricular activities, I love to dance(it makes me really exhilarated)
  and cook/read sometimes.I also have been the content co-ordinator for the entrepreneurship cell and worked with another club called bit-by-bit.</p>
